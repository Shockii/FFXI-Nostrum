Nostrum is not a tool I created and all rights reserved for the oringal creater.
I left Nostrum intact in its entierty but just adjust some things.

When using with trusts, just refresh Nostrum to have the trusts HP appear correctly.
//nostrum r
or in a macro 
/console lua r nostrum

Adjusted Nostrum to have the abilty to self cast when left clicking any of the spells.
Added an additional row for some AoE spells.
Will add a row for teleports later
