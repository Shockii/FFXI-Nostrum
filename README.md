Nostrum is not a tool I created and all rights reserved for the oringal creater.
I left Nostrum intact in its entierty but just adjust some things.

When using with trusts, just refresh Nostrum to have the trusts HP appear correctly.

Adjusted Nostrum to have the abilty to self cast when left clicking any of the spells.
Added an additional row for some AoE spells.
Will add a row for teleports later
